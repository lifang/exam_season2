There is going on a hot debate arguing whether they are good for the public or not, especially for college students.</p>\n<p>As for such a question, different people hold different views. Some believe that recreation is helpful if we want to keep healthy physically and mentally. While there also sounds an opposite voice, which claims that activities also bring many problems. For example, some young people are easily addicted to the virtual world online, which affects their study seriously and may lead to worse consequences as well.</p>\n\u3000 <p> As for me, I hold a belief that recreational activities do more good than harm.

It is true that people can gain knowledge from many ways like libraries, internet, and other sources, however, there is also much information that people cannot get from the above ways. Free admission museums supply more chances for the public to acquire knowledge that cannot be easily accessed. In this way, people can get exposed to more things about history, art, science and so on. \n\nAlthough this kind of policy has brought much convenience to the public, it has also caused some problems. For example, beggars and shabby-dressed people may enter the museums and cause bad reputation among the public; along with the increasing number of people getting into museums, there will be no enough service establishments to meet the requirements. Besides, under the policy of free admission, the cultural relics displayed there may be inevitably broken or damaged by the crowds. Moreover, the crowds in the museums may also cause security problems.\n\nIn my opinion, free admission is a good policy for the public, and it brings the public much convenience. But, we should also take possible measures to protect the cultural relics and maintain the order of spot. Besides, we can also take the policy of giving free admission first to children, then to the retired person, and last to the public. I think, this may help to solve the problems.\n","analysis":null},{"correct_type":"5","id":"621","score":"0.0","answer":"\u53c2\u8003\u8303\u6587\n\u3000\u3000<p align=\"center\">Creating a Green Campus</p>\n\u3000\u3000<p>Recently, with the idea of making and maintaining \u201ca green earth\u201d being the focus of the society, \u201cgreen campus\u201d has become a more and more popular concept in universities or colleges, which, undoubtedly, will bring us an ever-lasting benefit to both our campus and our society.</p>\n\u3000\u3000<p>The concept of \u201cgreen campus\u201d does not only mean a green environment but also refers to an environmental sense in people\u2019s mind.
