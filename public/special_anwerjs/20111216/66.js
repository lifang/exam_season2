After the child had been treated and was being prepared for discharge, Doctor Mayer talked to the parents about how they should care for the child at home. Also listening to her were a half a dozen other family members. A few hours later, when she came to say goodbye, the family asked her to settle an argument they\u2019d been having over exactly what advice she had given. \u201cAs I talked to them, I was amazed.\u201d she said, \u201cAll of them had heard the simple instructions I have given just a few hours before, but they have three or four different versions. The most basic details were unclear and confusing. I was surprised, because these were intelligent people.\u201d This episode gave Doctor Mayer her first clue to something every doctor learns sooner or later---- most people just don\u2019t listen very well. Nowadays, she says she repeats her instructions, and even conducts a reality check with some patients. She asks them to tell her what they think they are supposed to do. She also provides take-home sheets which are computer printouts tailored to the patients\u2019 situation. Doc. Mayer\u2019s listeners are not unusual.
