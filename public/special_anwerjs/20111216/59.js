There is going on a hot debate arguing whether they are good for the public or not, especially for college students.</p>\n<p>As for such a question, different people hold different views. Some believe that recreation is helpful if we want to keep healthy physically and mentally. While there also sounds an opposite voice, which claims that activities also bring many problems.
