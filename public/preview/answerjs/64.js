(30) Until recently, modern urban physicians heal the body, psychiatrist the mind, and priests the soul. However, the medical world is now paying more attention to holistic medicine, which is an approach based on the belief that people\u2019s state of mind can make them sick or speed their recovery from sickness. Several studies show that the effectiveness of a certain drug often depends on the patients\u2019 expectations of it. For example, in one recent study, psychiatrists at a major hospital tried to see how patients could be made calm. (31) They divided them into two groups. One group was given a drug while the other group received a harmless substance instead of medicine without their knowledge. Surprisingly, more patients in the second group showed the desired effect than those in the first group. In study after study, there\u2019s a positive reaction in almost one-third of the patients taking harmless substances. How was this possible? How can such a substance have an effect on the body? Evidence from a 1997 study at the University of California shows that several patients who received such substances were able to produce their own natural drug, that is, as they took the substance their brains released natural chemicals that act like a drug. (32) Scientists theorized that the amount of these chemicals released by a person\u2019s brain quite possibly indicates how much faith the person has in his or her doctor.\n32.

As psychologists, we need to ask ourselves (35): Why is this person doing this? Why do people take these risks and put themselves in danger when they don\u2019t have to? One common trait among risk-takers is that they enjoy strong feelings or sensations. (33) We call this trait sensation-seeking. A sensation-seeker is someone who\u2019s always looking for new sensations. What else do we know about sensation-seekers? Well, as I said, sensation-seekers like strong emotions. You can see this trait in many parts of a person\u2019s life, not just in extreme sports. For example, many sensation-seekers enjoy hard rock music. They like the loud sound and strong emotion of the songs. Similarly, sensation-seekers enjoy frightening horror movies. They like the feeling of being scared and horrified while watching the movie. This feeling is even stronger for extreme sports where the person faces real danger. Sensation-seekers feel the danger is very exciting. In addition, sensation-seekers like new experiences that force them to push their personal limits. For them, repeating the same things everyday is boring.(34) Many sensation-seekers choose jobs that involve risk, such as starting a new business or being an emergency room doctor. These jobs are different everyday, so they never know what will happen. That\u2019s why many sensation-seekers also like extreme sports. When you do rock-climbing, you never know what will happen.
