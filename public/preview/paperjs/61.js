Graduating them is another matter.Barry Mills, the president of Bowdoin College, was justifiably proud of Bowdoin\u2019s efforts to recruit minority students. Since 2003 the small, elite liberal arts school in Brunswick, Maine, has boosted the proportion of so-called under-represented minority students in entering freshman classes from 8% to 13%.\u201cIt is our responsibility to reach out and attract students to come to our kinds of places,\u201d he told a NEWSWEEK reporter. But Bowdoin has not done quite as well when it comes to actually graduating minorities. While 9 out of 10 white students routinely get their diplomas within six years, only 7 out of 10 black students made it to graduation day in several recent classes.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u201cIf you look at who enters college, it now looks like America,\u201d says Hilary Pennington, director of postsecondary programs for the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which has closely studied enrollment patterns in higher education. \u201cBut if you look at who walks across the stage for a diploma, it\u2019s still largely the white, upper-income population.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States once had the highest graduation rate of any nation. Now it stands 10th. For the first time in American history, there is the risk that the rising generation will be less well educated than the previous one. The graduation rate among 25- to 34-year-olds is no better than the rate for the 55- to 64-year-olds who were going to college more than 30 years ago. Studies show that more and more poor and non-white students want to graduate from college\u2014but their graduation rates fall far short of their dreams. The graduation rates for blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans lag far behind the graduation rates for whites and Asians. As the minority population grows in the United States, low college graduation rates become a threat to national prosperity.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n</p>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is pronounced at public universities. In 2007 the University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2014one of the top five or so prestigious public universities\u2014graduated 81% of its white students within six years, but only 56% of its blacks. At less-selective state schools, the numbers get worse. During the same time frame, the University of Northern Iowa graduated 67% of its white students, but only 39% of its blacks. Community colleges have low graduation rates generally\u2014but rock-bottom rates for minorities. A recent review of California community colleges found that while a third of the Asian students picked up their degrees, only 15% of African-Americans did so as well.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private colleges and universities generally do better, partly because they offer smaller classes and more personal attention. But when it comes to a significant graduation gap, Bowdoin has company. Nearby Colby College logged an 18-point difference between white and black graduates in 2007 and 25 points in 2006. Middlebury College in Vermont, another top school, had a 19-point gap in 2007 and a 22-point gap in 2006. The most selective private schools\u2014Harvard, Yale, and Princeton\u2014show almost no gap between black and white graduation rates. But that may have more to do with their ability to select the best students. According to data gathered by Harvard Law School professor Lani Guinier, the most selective schools are more likely to choose blacks who have at least one immigrant parent from Africa or the Caribbean than black students who are descendants of American slaves.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u201cHigher education has been able to duck this issue for years, particularly the more selective schools, by saying the responsibility is on the individual student,\u201d says Pennington of the Gates Foundation. \u201cIf they fail, it\u2019s their fault.\u201d Some critics blame affirmative action\u2014students admitted with lower test scores and grades from shaky high schools often struggle at elite schools. But a bigger problem may be that poor high schools often send their students to colleges for which they are \u201cundermatched\u201d: they could get into more elite, richer schools, but instead go to community colleges and low-rated state schools that lack the resources to help them. Some schools out for profit cynically increase tuitions and count on student loans and federal aid to foot the bill\u2014knowing full well that the students won\u2019t make it.\u201cThe school keeps the money, but the kid leaves with loads of debt and no degree and no ability to get a better job. Colleges are not holding up their end,\u201d says Amy Wilkins of the Education Trust.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A college education is getting ever more expensive. Since 1982 tuitions have been rising at roughly twice the rate of inflation. In 2008 the net cost of attending a four-year public university\u2014after financial aid\u2014equaled 28% of median \uff08\u4e2d\u95f4\u7684\uff09 family income, while a four-year private university cost 76% of median family income. More and more scholarships are based on merit, not need. Poorer students are not always the best-informed consumers. Often they wind up deeply in debt or simply unable to pay after a year or two and must drop out.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There once was a time when universities took pride in their dropout rates. Professors would begin the year by saying, \u201cLook to the right and look to the left. One of you is not going to be here by the end of the year.\u201d But such a Darwinian spirit is beginning to give way as at least a few colleges face up to the graduation gap. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the gap has been roughly halved over the last three years. The university has poured resources into peer counseling to help students from inner-city schools adjust to the rigor\uff08\u4e25\u683c\u8981\u6c42\uff09 and faster pace of a university classroom\u2014and also to help minority students overcome the stereotype that they are less qualified. Wisconsin has a \u201claserlike focus\u201d on building up student skills in the first three months, according to vice provost \uff08\u6559\u52a1\u957f\uff09 Damon Williams.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State and federal governments could sharpen that focus everywhere by broadly publishing minority graduation rates. For years private colleges such as Princeton and MIT have had success bringing minorities onto campus in the summer before freshman year to give them some preparatory courses. The newer trend is to start recruiting poor and non-white students as early as the seventh grade, using innovative tools to identify kids with sophisticated verbal skills. Such programs can be expensive, of course, but cheap compared with the millions already invested in scholarships and grants for kids who have little chance to graduate without special support.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With effort and money, the graduation gap can be closed. Washington and Lee is a small, selective school in Lexington, Va. Its student body is less than 5% black and less than 2% Latino. While the school usually graduated about 90% of its whites, the graduation rate of its blacks and Latinos had dipped to 63% by 2007.\u201cWe went through a dramatic shift,\u201d says Dawn Watkins, the vice president for student affairs. The school aggressively pushed mentoring \uff08\u8f85\u5bfc\uff09 of minorities by other students and\u201cpartnering\u201d with parents at a special pre-enrollment session. The school had its first-ever black homecoming. Last spring the school graduated the same proportion of minorities as it did whites. If the United States wants to keep up in the global economic race, it will have to pay systematic attention to graduating minorities, not just enrolling them.\n                    ","category":"3","questions":{"question":[{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"2527","score":"","description":"What is the author\u2019s main concern about American higher education?","questionattrs":"The small proportion of minority students.\t;-;The low graduation rates of minority students. ;-;

Consider these scenarios:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It\u2019s late in the day. That front-page package you\u2019ve been working on is nearly complete; one last edit and it\u2019s finished. Enter the executive editor, who makes a suggestion requiring a more-than-modest rearrangement of the design and the addition of an information box. You want to scream: \u201cNo!

That issue is already decided. The third rule is to be ready to cite options and consequences. The boss\u2019s suggestions might be appropriate, but there are always consequences. She might not know about the pages backing up that need attention, or about the designer who had to go home sick. Tell her she can have what she wants, but explain the consequences.

The American public overwhelmingly thinks they\u2019re bad. Yet the consensus among most economists is that immigration, both legal and illegal, provides a small net boost to the economy. Immigrants provide cheap labor, lower the prices of everything from farm produce to new homes, and leave consumers with a little more money in their pockets. So why is there such a discrepancy between the perception of immigrants\u2019 impact on the economy and the reality?<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are a number of familiar theories. Some argue that people are anxious and feel threatened by an inflow of new workers. Others highlight the strain that undocumented immigrants place on public services, like schools, hospitals, and jails. Still others emphasize the role of race, arguing that foreigners add to the nation\u2019s fears and insecurities. There\u2019s some truth to all these explanations, but they aren\u2019t quite sufficient.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To get a better understanding of what\u2019s going on, consider the way immigration\u2019s impact is felt. Though its overall effect may be positive, its costs and benefits are distributed unevenly. David Card, an economist at UC Berkeley, notes that the ones who profit most directly from immigrants\u2019 low-cost labor are businesses and employers\u2014meatpacking plants in Nebraska, for instance, or agricultural businesses in California. Granted, these producers\u2019 savings probably translate into lower prices at the grocery store, but how many consumers make that mental connection at the checkout counter? As for the drawbacks of illegal immigration, these, too, are concentrated. Native low-skilled workers suffer most from the competition of foreign labor. According to a study by George Borjas, a Harvard economist, immigration reduced the wages of American high-school dropouts by 9% between 1980-2000.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Among high-skilled, better-educated employees, however, opposition was strongest in states with both high numbers of immigrants and relatively generous social services. What worried them most, in other words, was the fiscal \uff08\u8d22\u653f\u7684\uff09 burden of immigration. That conclusion was reinforced by another finding: that their opposition appeared to soften when that fiscal burden decreased, as occurred with welfare reform in the 1990s, which curbed immigrants\u2019 access to certain benefits.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The irony is that for all the overexcited debate, the net effect of immigration is minimal. Even for those most acutely affected\u2014say, low-skilled workers, or California residents\u2014the impact isn\u2019t all that dramatic.\u201cThe unpleasant voices have tended to dominate our perceptions,\u201d says Daniel Tichenor, a political science professor at the University of Oregon, \u201cBut when all those factors are put together and the economists calculate the numbers, it ends up being a net positive, but a small one.\u201d Too bad most people don\u2019t realize it.\n                    ","category":"3","questions":{"question":[{"correct_type":"0","flag":"0","id":"2637","score":"0.0","description":"What can we learn from the first paragraph?","questionattrs":"Whether immigrants are good or bad for the economy has been puzzling economists.;-;The American economy used to thrive on immigration but now it\u2019s a different story.;-;The consensus among economists is that immigration should not be encouraged.;-;The general public thinks differently from most economists on the impact of immigration.","tags":" \u9605\u8bfb","words":"overwhelmingly;consensus;boost;discrepancy;perception;thrive"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"2641","score":"","description":"In what way does the author think ordinary Americans benefit from immigration?","questionattrs":"They can access all kinds of public services. ;-; They can get consumer goods at lower prices. \t;-;They can mix with people of different cultures.\t;-;They can avoid doing much of the manual labor.","tags":" \u9605\u8bfb","words":"threaten;inflow;strain;undocumented;jail;emphasize;sufficient;overall;distribute;unevenly;agricultural;granted;grocery;drawback;concentrate;competition"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"2645","score":"","description":"Why do native low-skilled workers suffer most from illegal immigration?","questionattrs":"They have greater difficulty getting welfare support.;-;They are more likely to encounter interracial conflicts.;-;They have a harder time getting a job with decent pay.;-;They are no match for illegal immigrants in labor skills.","tags":" \u9605\u8bfb","words":"dropout;interracial;decent"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"2646","score":"","description":"What is the chief concern of native high-skilled, better-educated employees about the inflow of immigrants?","questionattrs":"It may change the existing social structure. ;-;It may pose a threat to their economic status. \t;-;It may lead to social instability in the country.;-; It may place a great strain on the state budget.","tags":" \u9605\u8bfb","words":"opposition;relatively;fiscal;burden;conclusion;reinforce;soften;curb;reform;existing;instability;strain;budget"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"2649","score":"","description":"What is the irony about the debate over immigration?","questionattrs":" Even economists can\u2019t reach a consensus about its impact.;-;Those who are opposed to it turn out to benefit most from it.;-;People are making too big a fuss about something of small impact.;-;There is no essential difference between seemingly opposite opinions.","tags":" \u9605\u8bfb","words":"irony;overexcited;minimal;acutely;dominate;perception;calculate;fuss;seemingly"}]}},{"id":"1214","question_type":"0","description":null,"title":"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Picture a typical MBA lecture theatre twenty years ago. In it the majority of students will have conformed to the standard model of the time: male, middle class and Western. Walk into a class today, however, and you\u2019ll get a completely different impression. For a start, you will now see plenty more women\u2014the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, for example, boasts that 40% of its new enrolment is female. You will also see a wide range of ethnic groups and nationals of practically every country.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It might be tempting, therefore, to think that the old barriers have been broken down and equal opportunity achieved. But, increasingly, this apparent diversity is becoming a mask for a new type of conformity. Behind the differences in sex, skin tones and mother tongues, there are common attitudes, expectations and ambitions which risk creating a set of clones among the business leaders of the future.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Diversity, it seems, has not helped to address fundamental weaknesses in business leadership. So what can be done to create more effective managers of the commercial world? According to Valerie Gauthier, associate dean at HEC Paris, the key lies in the process by which MBA programmes recruit their students. At the moment candidates are selected on a fairly narrow set of criteria such as prior academic and career performance, and analytical and problem solving abilities. This is then coupled to a school\u2019s picture of what a diverse class should look like, with the result that passport, ethnic origin and sex can all become influencing factors. But schools rarely dig down to find out what really makes an applicant succeed, to create a class which also contains diversity of attitude and approach\u2014arguably the only diversity that, in a business context, really matters.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Professor Gauthier believes schools should not just be selecting candidates from traditional sectors such as banking, consultancy and industry. They should also be seeking individuals who have backgrounds in areas such as political science, the creative arts, history or philosophy, which will allow them to put business decisions into a wider context.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Indeed, there does seem to be a demand for the more rounded leaders such diversity might create. A study by Mannaz, a leadership development company, suggests that, while the bully-boy chief executive of old may not have been eradicated completely, there is a definite shift in emphasis towards less tough styles of management\u2014at least in America and Europe. Perhaps most significant, according to Mannaz, is the increasing interest large companies have in more collaborative management models, such as those prevalent in Scandinavia, which seek to integrate the hard and soft aspects of leadership and encourage delegated responsibility and accountability.<br />\n                    ","category":"3","questions":null}]}}]},"problem_ids":null}}
