During one interview, she noticed that the candidate never made direct eye contact. She was puzzled and somewhat disappointed because she liked the individual otherwise.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had a perfect r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and gave good responses to her questions, but the fact that he never looked her in the eye said \u201cuntrustworthy,\u201d so she decided to offer the job to her second choice.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I attended a diversity workshop that I realized the person we passed over was the perfect person,\u201d Tiffany confesses. What she hadn\u2019t known at the time of the interview was that the candidate\u2019s \u201cdifferent\u201d behavior was simply a cultural misunderstanding. He was an Asian-American raised in a household where respect for those in authority was shown by averting (\u907f\u5f00) your eyes.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u201cI was just thrown off by the lack of eye contact; not realizing it was cultural,\u201d Tiffany says. \u201cI missed out, but will not miss that opportunity again.\u201d&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many of us have had similar encounters with behaviors we perceive as different. As the world becomes smaller and our workplaces more diverse, it is becoming essential to expand our understanding of others and to reexamine some of our false assumptions.</div><div>&nbsp;Hire Advantage</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At a time when hiring qualified people is becoming more difficult, employers who can eliminate invalid biases (\u504f\u89c1) from the process have a distinct advantage. My company, Mindsets LLC, helps organizations and individuals see their own blind spots. A real estate recruiter we worked with illustrates the positive difference such training can make. &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u201cDuring my Mindsets coaching session, I was taught how to recruit a diversified workforce. I recruited people from different cultures and skill sets. The agents were able to utilize their full potential and experiences to build up the company. When the real estate market began to change, it was because we had a diverse agent pool that we were able to stay in the real estate market much longer than others in the same profession.\u201d</div><div>&nbsp;Blinded by Gender&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dale is an account executive who attended one of my workshops on supervising a diverse workforce. \u201cThrough one of the sessions, I discovered my personal bias,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI learned I had not been looking at a person as a whole person, and being open to differences.\u201d In his case, the blindness was not about culture but rather gender.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u201cI had a management position open in my department; and the two finalists were a man and a woman. Had I not attended this workshop, I would have automatically assumed the man was the best candidate because the position required quite a bit of extensive travel. My reasoning would have been that even though both candidates were great and could have been successful in the position, I assumed the woman would have wanted to be home with her children and not travel.\u201d Dale\u2019s assumptions are another example of the well-intentioned but incorrect thinking that limits an organization\u2019s ability to tap into the full potential of a diverse workforce.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\u201cI learned from the class that instead of imposing my gender biases into the situation, I needed to present the full range of duties, responsibilities and expectations to all candidates and allow them to make an informed decision.\u201d Dale credits the workshop, \u201cbecause it helped me make decisions based on fairness.\u201d</div><div>&nbsp;Year of the Know-It-All&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Doug is another supervisor who attended one of my workshops. He recalls a major lesson learned from his own employee.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u201cOne of my most embarrassing moments was when I had a Chinese-American employee put in a request to take time off to celebrate Chinese New Year. In my ignorance, I assumed he had his dates wrong, as the first of January had just passed. When I advised him of this, I gave him a long talking-to about turning in requests early with the proper dates.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\u201cHe patiently waited, then when I was done, he said he would like Chinese New Year off, not the Western New Year. He explained politely that in his culture the new year did not begin January first, and that Chinese New Year, which is tied to the lunar cycle, is one of the most celebrated holidays on the Chinese calendar. Needless to say, I felt very embarrassed in assuming he had his dates mixed up. But I learned a great deal about assumptions, and that the timing of holidays varies considerably from culture to culture.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\u201cAttending the diversity workshop helped me realize how much I could learn by simply asking questions and creating dialogues with my employees, rather than making assumptions and trying to be a know-it-all,\u201d Doug admits. \u201cThe biggest thing I took away from the workshop is learning how to be more \u2018inclusive\u2019 to differences.\u201d&nbsp;</div><div>A Better Bottom Line</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An open mind about diversity not only improves organizations internally, it is profitable as well. These comments from a customer service representative show how an inclusive attitude can improve sales. \u201cMost of my customers speak English as a second language. One of the best things my company has done is to contract with a language service that offers translations over the phone. It wasn\u2019t until my boss received Mindsets\u2019 training that she was able to understand how important inclusiveness was to customer service. As a result, our customer base has increased.\u201d</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once we start to see people as individuals, and discard the stereotypes, we can move positively toward inclusiveness for everyone. Diversity is about coming together and taking advantage of our differences and similarities. It is about building better communities and organizations that enhance us as individuals and reinforce our shared humanity.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When we begin to question our assumptions and challenge what we think we have learned from our past, from the media, peers, family, friends, etc., we begin to realize that some of our conclusions are flawed (\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u7684) or contrary to our fundamental values. We need to train ourselves to think differently, shift our mindsets and realize that diversity opens doors for all of us, creating opportunities in organizations and communities that benefit everyone.</div>","category":"2","questions":{"question":[{"correct_type":"0","id":"530","score":"0.0","description":"What bothered Tiffany during an interview with her candidate?","questionattrs":"A) He just wouldn\u2019t look her in the eye.;-;B) He was slow in answering her questions.;-;C) His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 didn\u2019t provide the necessary information.;-;D) His answers to some of her questions were irrelevant.","tags":"\u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb"},{"correct_type":"0","id":"531","score":"0.0","description":"Tiffany\u2019s misjudgment about the candidate stemmed from __.","questionattrs":"A) racial stereotypes;-;B) invalid personal bias;-;C) cultural ignorance;-;D) emphasis on physical appearance","tags":"\u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb"},{"correct_type":"0","id":"532","score":"0.0","description":"What is becoming essential in the course of economic globalization according to the author?","questionattrs":"A) Hiring qualified technical and management personnel.;-;B) Increasing understanding of people of other cultures.;-;C) Constantly updating knowledge and equipment.;-;D) Expanding domestic and international markets.","tags":"\u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb"},{"correct_type":"0","id":"533","score":"0.0","description":"What kind of organization is Mindsets LLC?","questionattrs":"A) A real estate agency.;-;B) A personnel training company.;-;C) A cultural exchange organization.;-;D) A hi-tech company.","tags":"\u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb"},{"correct_type":"0","id":"534","score":"0.0","description":"After one of the workshops, account executive Dale realized that __.","questionattrs":"A) he had hired the wrong person;-;B) he could have done more for his company;-;C) he had not managed his workforce well;-;D) he must get rid of his gender bias","tags":"\u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb"},{"correct_type":"0","id":"535","score":"0.0","description":"What did Dale think of Mindsets LLC\u2019s workshop?","questionattrs":"A) It was well-intentioned but poorly conducted.;-;B) It tapped into the executives\u2019 full potential.;-;C) It helped him make fair decisions.;-;D) It met participants\u2019 diverse needs.","tags":"\u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb"},{"correct_type":"0","id":"536","score":"0.0","description":"How did Doug, a supervisor, respond to a Chinese-American employee\u2019s request for leave?","questionattrs":"A) He told him to get the dates right.;-;B) He demanded an explanation.;-;C) He flatly turned it down.;-;D) He readily approved it.","tags":"\u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb"},{"correct_type":"3","id":"537","score":"0.0","description":"Doug felt __  when he realized that his assumption was wrong.","questionattrs":null,"tags":"\u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb"},{"correct_type":"3","id":"538","score":"0.0","description":"After attending Mindsets\u2019 workshops, the participants came to know the importance of __ to their business.\n                            ","questionattrs":null,"tags":"\u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb"},{"correct_type":"3","id":"539","score":"0.0","description":"When we view people as individuals and get rid of stereotypes, we can achieve diversity and benefit from the __ between us.\n                            ","questionattrs":null,"tags":"\u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb"}]}}}},{"id":"33","start_time":"1:20","time":"35","total_num":"36","total_score":"0.0","base_info":{"title":"Part III\tListening Comprehension\t","description":"<mp3>/media/paper/2009_06.mp3<mp3>((mp3))/media/paper/2009_06.mp3((mp3))"},"problems":{"problem":[{"part_description":"        Section A\n<br>Directions:\tIn this section, you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations.

Organized by the New York-based nonprofit Earth Pledge, the show inspired many top designers to work with sustainable fabrics for the first time. Several have since made pledges to include organic fabrics in their lines.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The designers who undertake green fashion still face many challenges. Scott Hahn, cofounder with Gregory of Rogan and Loomstate, which uses all-organic cotton, says high-quality sustainable materials can still be tough to find. \u201cMost designers with existing labels are finding there aren\u2019t comparable fabrics that can just replace what you\u2019re doing and what your customers are used to,\u201d he says. For example, organic cotton and non-organic cotton are virtually indistinguishable once woven into a dress. But some popular synthetics, like stretch nylon, still have few eco-friendly equivalents.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those who do make the switch are finding they have more support. Last year the influential trade show Designers &amp; Agents stopped charging its participation fee for young green entrepreneurs (\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bb6) who attend its two springtime shows in Los Angeles and New York and gave special recognition to designers whose collections are at least 25% sustainable. It now counts more than 50 green designers, up from fewer than a dozen two years ago. This week Wal-Mart is set to announce a major initiative aimed at helping cotton farmers go organic: it will buy transitional (\u8fc7\u6e21\u578b\u7684) cotton at higher prices, thus helping to expand the supply of a key sustainable material. \u201cMainstream is about to occur,\u201d says Hahn.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some analysts (\u5206\u6790\u5e08) are less sure. Among consumers, only 18% are even aware that ecofashion exists, up from 6% four years ago. Natalie Hormilla, a fashion writer, is an example of the unconverted consumer. When asked if she owned any sustainable clothes, she replied: \u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d Like most consumers, she finds little time to shop, and when she does, she\u2019s on the hunt for \u201ccute stuff that isn\u2019t too expensive.\u201d By her own admission, green just isn\u2019t yet on her mind.
