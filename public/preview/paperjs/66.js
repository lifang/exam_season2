Millions of us get up each morning already weary over the day holds. \u201cI just can\u2019t get started\u201d people say. But it\u2019s not physical energy that most of us lack. Sure, we could all use extra sleep and a better diet. But in truth, people are healthier today than at any time in history. I can almost guarantee that if you long for more energy, the problem is not with your body.<br />\n&nbsp;What you\u2019re seeking is not physical energy. It\u2019s emotional energy. Yet, sad to say life sometimes seems designed to exhaust our supply. We work too hard. We have family obligations. We encounter emergencies and personal crises. No wonder so many of us suffer from emotional fatigue, a kind of utter exhaustion of the spirit.<br />\n&nbsp;And yet we all know people who are filled with joy, despite the unpleasant circum stances of their lives. Eyen as a child observed people who were poor or disabled or ill, but who nonetheless faced life with optimism and vigor. Consider Laura Hillenbrand, who despite an extremely weak body wrote the best-seller Seabiscuit. Hillenbrand barely had enough physical energy to drag herself out of be to write. But she was fueled by having a story she wanted to share. It was emotional energy that helped her succeed.<br />\n&nbsp;Unlike physical energy, which is finite and diminishes with age, emotional energy is unlimited and has nothing to do with genes or up bringing. So how do you get it? You can\u2019t simply tell yourself to be positive. You must take action. Here are six practical strategies that work.<br />\n&nbsp;1.Do something new.<br />\n&nbsp;Very little that\u2019s new occurs in our lives. The impact of this sameness on our emotional energy is gradual, but huge: It's like a tire with a slow leak. You don't it at first, but eventually you'll get a flat. It's up to you to plug the leak--even though there are always a dozen reasons to stay stuck in your dull routines of life. That's where Maura, 36, a waitress, found herself a year ago.<br />\n&nbsp;Fortunately, Maura had a lifeline--a group of women friends who meet regularly to discuss their lives. Their lively discussions spurred Maura to make small but nevertheless life altering changes. She joined a gym in the next town. She changed her look with a short haircut and new black T-shirts. Eventually, Maura gathered the courage to quit her job and start her own business.<br />\n&nbsp;Here's a challenge: If it's something you wouldn't ordinarily do, do it. Try a dish you've never eaten. Listen to music you'd ordinarily tune out. You'll discover these small things add to your emotional energy.<br />\n&nbsp;2.Reclaim life's meaning.<br />\n&nbsp;So many of my patients tell me that their lives used to have meaning, but that somewhere along the line things went state.<br />\n&nbsp;The first step in solving this meaning shortage is to figure out what you really care about, and then do something about it. A case in point is Ivy, 57, a pioneer in investment banking. \"I mistakenly believed that all the money I made would mean something.\" she says. \"But I feel lost, like a 22-year-old wondering what to do with her life.\" Ivy's solution? She started a program that shows Wall Streeters how to donate time and money to poor children. In the process, Ivy filled her life with meaning.<br />\n&nbsp;3.Put yourself in the fun zone.<br />\n&nbsp;Most of us grown-ups are seriously fun-deprived. High-energy people have the same day-to-day work as the rest of us, but they manage to find something enjoyable in every situation. A real estate broker I know keeps herself amused on the job by mentally redecorating the houses she shows to clients. \"I love imagining what even the most run-down house could look like withy a little tender loving care,\" she says. \"It's a challenge--and the least desirable properties are usually the most fun.\"<br />\n&nbsp;We all define fun differently, of course, but I can guarantee this: If you put just a bit of it into your day, you energy will increase quickly.<br />\n&nbsp;4.Bid farewell to guilt and regret.<br />\n&nbsp;Everyone's past is filled with regrets that still cause pain. But from an emotional energy point of view, they are dead weights that keep us from us from moving forward. While they can't merely be willed away, I do recommend you remind yourself that whatever happened is in the past, and nothing can change that. Holding on to the memory only allows the damage to continue into the present.<br />\n&nbsp;5.Make up your mind.<br />\n&nbsp;Say you\u2019ve been thinking about cutting your hair short. Will it look stylish \u2013 or too extreme?<br />\n&nbsp;You endlessly think it over. Having the decision hanging over your head is a huge energy drain.<br />\n&nbsp;Every time you can\u2019t decide, you burden yourself with alternatives. Quit thinking that you have to make the right decision; instead, make a choice and don\u2019t look back.<br />\n&nbsp;6.Give to get.<br />\n&nbsp;Emotional energy has a kind of magical quality; the more you give, the more you get back. This is the difference between emotional and physical energy. With the latter., You have to get it to be able to give it. With the former, however, you get it by giving it.<br />\n&nbsp;Start by asking everyone you meet, \u201cHow are you?\u201d as if you really want to know, then listen to the reply. Be the one who hears. Most of us also need to smile more often. If you don\u2019t smile at the person you love first thing in the morning, you\u2019re sucking energy out of your relationship. Finally, help another person\u2014and make the help real, concrete. Give a massage (\u6309\u6469) to someone you love, or cook her dinner, Then, expand the circle to work. Try asking yourself what you\u2019d do if your goal were to be helpful rather than efficient.<br />\n&nbsp;After all, if it\u2019s true that what goes around comes around, why not make sure that what\u2019s circulating around you is the good stuff?","category":"2","questions":{"question":[{"correct_type":"0","flag":"0","id":"3687","score":"0.0","description":"The energy crisis in America discussed here mainly refers to a shortage of fossil fuels.","questionattrs":"Y;-;N;-;NG","tags":" \u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb","words":"energy;crisis;fossil;shortage;refer"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"3688","score":"","description":"People these days tend to lack physical energy.","questionattrs":"Y;-;N;-;NG","tags":" \u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb","words":"tend;lack;physical"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"3689","score":"","description":"Laura Hillenbrand is an example cited to show how emotional energy can contribute to one\u2019s success in life.","questionattrs":"Y;-;N;-;NG","tags":" \u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb","words":"cite;emotional;contribute;success"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"3691","score":"","description":"The author believes emotional energy is inherited and genetically determined.","questionattrs":"Y;-;N;-;NG","tags":" \u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb","words":"inherit;genetic;upbringing"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"3692","score":"","description":"Even small changes people make in their lives can help increase their emotional energy.","questionattrs":"Y;-;N;-;NG","tags":" \u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb","words":"challenge;ordinary"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"3694","score":"","description":"They filled her life with meaning by launching a program to help poor children.","questionattrs":"Y;-;N;-;NG","tags":" \u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb","words":"reclaim;procession;fill;launch"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"3696","score":"","description":"The real-estate broker the author knows is talented in home redecoration.","questionattrs":"Y;-;N;-;NG","tags":" \u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb","words":"real-estate;broker;talented;redecoration"},{"correct_type":"3","flag":"","id":"3697","score":"","description":"People holding on to sad memories of the past will find it difficult to__________.","questionattrs":null,"tags":" \u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb","words":"forward;farewell;guilt;weight"},{"correct_type":"3","flag":"","id":"3699","score":"","description":"When it comes to decision-making.

As a boy, he spent time in the larger cities of Italy, France and Switzerland, where bottled water is consumed daily. Even then, he kept a water journal, noting the brands he liked best. \u201cMy dog could tell the difference between bottled and tap water.\u201d He says.<br />\n[3] But is plain tap water all that bad? Not at all. In fact, New York\u2019s municipal water for more than a century was called the champagne of tap water and until recently considered among the best in the world in terms of both taste and purity. Similarly, a magazine in England found that tap water from the Thames River tasted better than several leading brands of bottled water that were 400 times more expensive.<br />\n[4] Nevertheless, soft-drink companies view bottled water as the next battle-ground for market share-this despite the fact that over 25 percent of bottled water comes from tap water: PepsiCo\u2019s Aquafina and Coca-Cola\u2019s Dasani are both purified tap water rather than spring water.<br />\n[5] As diners thirst for leading brands, bottlers and restaurateurs salivate(\u5782\u6d8e) over the profits. A restaurant\u2019s typical mark-up on wine is 100 to 150 percent, whereas on bottled water it\u2019s often 300 to 500 percent. But since water is much cheaper than wine, and many of the fancier brands aren\u2019t available in stores, most diners don\u2019t notice or care.<br />\n[6] As a result, some restaurants are turning up the pressure to sell bottled water. According to an article in The Wall Street Journal, some of the more shameless tactics include placing attractive bottles on the table for a visual sell, listing brands on the menu without prices, and pouring bottled water without even asking the dinners if they want it.<br />\n[7] Regardless of how it\u2019s sold, the popularity of bottled water taps into our desire for better health, our wish to appear cultivated, and even a longing for lost purity.","category":"2","questions":{"question":[{"correct_type":"0","flag":"0","id":"3756","score":"0.0","description":"What do we know about Iceberg Water from the passage?","questionattrs":"It is a kind of iced water.;-;It is just plain tap water.;-;It is a kind of bottled water.;-;It is a kind of mineral water.","tags":" \u9605\u8bfb","words":"bottled;tap;mineral;reach;peak;popularity;harvest;coast"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"3758","score":"","description":"By saying \u201c My dog could tell the difference between bottled and tap water\u201d (Para 2), von Wiesenberger wants to convey the message that ___.","questionattrs":"plain tap water is certainly unfit for drinking;-;bottled water is clearly superior to tap water;-;bottled water often appeals more to dogs taste;-;dogs can usually detect a fine difference in taste","tags":" \u9605\u8bfb","words":"difference;convey;superior;unfit;appeal;detect;fine;taste"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"3759","score":"","description":"The \u201cfancier brands\u201d (Para 5) refers to ____","questionattrs":"tap water from the Thames River;-;famous wines not sold in ordinary stores;-;PepsiCo\u2019s Aquafina and Coca-Cola\u2019s Dasani;-;expensive bottled water with impressive names","tags":" \u9605\u8bfb","words":"fancy;refer;impressive;diner"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"3760","score":"","description":"Why are some restaurants turning up the pressure to sell bottled water?","questionattrs":"Bottled water brings in huge profits;-;Competition from the wine industry is intense;-;Most diners find bottled water affordable;-;Bottled water satisfied diners\u2019 desire to fashionable","tags":" \u9605\u8bfb","words":"turn up;pressure;profit;competition;intense"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"3761","score":"","description":"According to passage, why is bottled water so popular?","questionattrs":"It is much cheaper than wine.;-;It is considered healthier.;-;It appeals to more cultivated people.;-;It is more widely promoted in the market.","tags":" \u9605\u8bfb","words":"tap;popular;cultivated;promote;innocence"}]}},{"id":"1507","question_type":"0","description":null,"title":"[1]As we have seen, the focus of medical care in our society has been shifting from curing disease to preventing disease \u2013 especially in terms of changing our many unhealthy behaviors, such as poor eating habits, smoking, and failure to exercise. The line of thought involved in this shift can be pursued further. Imagine a person who is about the right weight , but does not eat very nutritious(\u6709\u8425\u517b\u7684) foods, who feels OK but exercises only occasionally, who goes to work every day, but is not an outstanding worker, who drinks a few beers at home most nights but does not drive while drunk , and who has no chest pains or abnormal blood counts, but sleeps a lot and often feels tired.

Both types have simply been called \u201cwell\u201d. In recent years, however, some health specialists have begun to apply the terms \u201cwell\u201d and \u201cwellness\u201d only to those who are actively striving to maintain and improve their health. People who are well are concerned with nutrition and exercise and they make a point of monitoring their body's condition. Most important, perhaps, people who are well take active responsibility for all matters related to their health. Even people who have a physical disease or handicap (\u7f3a\u9677) may be \"well,\" in this new sense, if they make an effort to maintain the best possible health they can in the face of their physical limitations. \"Wellness\" may perhaps best be viewed not as a state that people can achieve, but as an ideal that people can strive for. People who are well are likely to be better able to resist disease and to fight disease when it strikes. And by focusing attention on healthy ways of living, the concept of wellness can have a beneficial impact on the ways in which people face the challenges of daily life.<br />","category":"2","questions":{"question":[{"correct_type":"0","flag":"0","id":"3762","score":"0.0","description":"Today medical care is placing more stress on______.","questionattrs":"keeping people in a healthy physical condition;-;monitoring patients' body functions;-;removing people's bad living habits;-;ensuring people's psychological well-being","tags":" \u9605\u8bfb","words":"stress;medical;monitor;function;remove;ensure;psychological;well-being;shift;cure;prevent;failure;behavior"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"3764","score":"","description":"In the first paragraph, people are reminded that_____.","questionattrs":"good health is more than not being ill;-;drinking, even if not to excess, could be harmful;-;regular health checks are essential to keeping fit;-;prevention is more difficult than cure","tags":" \u9605\u8bfb","words":"imagine;excess;harmful;essential;regular;prevention"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"3769","score":"","description":"Traditionally, a person is considered \"well\" if he ______.","questionattrs":"does not have any unhealthy living habits;-;does not have any physical handicaps;-;is able to handle his daily routines;-;is free from any kind of disease","tags":" \u9605\u8bfb","words":"traditional;handicap;routine;handle;disease"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"3772","score":"","description":"According to the author, the true meaning of \"wellness\" is for people _____.","questionattrs":"to best satisfy their body's special needs;-;to strive to maintain the best possible health;-;to meet the strictest standards of bodily health;-;to keep a proper balance between work and leisure","tags":" \u9605\u8bfb","words":"satisfy;strive;maintain;standard;balance;leisure;achieve;ideal;wellness"},{"correct_type":"0","flag":"","id":"3776","score":"","description":"According to what the author advocates, which of the following groups of people would be considered healthy?","questionattrs":"People who have strong muscles as well as slim figures.;-;People who are not presently experiencing any symptoms of disease.;-;People who try to be as healthy as possible, regardless of their limitations.;-;People who can recover from illness even without seeking medical care.","tags":" \u9605\u8bfb","words":"advocate;muscle;slim;figure;symptom;limitation;recover;illness;medical"}]}}]}},{"id":"4","start_time":"","time":"","total_num":"20","total_score":"0.0","base_info":{"title":"Part V Cloze ","description":null},"problems":{"problem":{"id":"1515","question_type":"1","description":null,"title":"Language is the most astonishing behavior in the animal kingdom.
